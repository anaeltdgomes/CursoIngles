O passado perfeito é usado para ações ou eventos que aconteceram no passado antes de outra ação ou evento no passado.

Regras gramaticais

Assim como o presente perfeito, o pretérito perfeito é formado usando o verbo auxiliar “to have” (na forma past simple), bem como o particípio passado.

SUBJECT			AUXILIAR		SHORT FORM		PAST PARTICIPLE
I, you, he, she, it, we, they	had		I’d, you’d, he’d, she’d, it’d, we’d, they’d		studied, visited, worked…


Estrutura

1. Affirmative Sentences

Subject + “had” + past participle…

Examples:
 
I had [I’d] visited the Louvre before, so I knew where the Mona Lisa was.
 
They had [They’d] studied English before they went to London.
 
Henry changed careers because he had [he’d] worked as an accountant for many years and was bored.


2. Negative Sentences

Subject + “had” + past participle…

Examples:

I had not [hadn’t] visited the Louvre before so I didn’t know where the Mona Lisa was.
 
They had not [hadn’t] studied English before they went to London.
 
Henry changed careers even though he had not [hadn’t] worked as an accountant for long.


3. Interrogative Sentences

“Had” + subject + past participle…?

Examples:
 
How did you know where the Mona Lisa was? Had you visited the Louvre before?
 
Had they studied English before they went to London?
 
Had Henry worked as an accountant for long before he changed careers?


Onde é usado?

1. We use the past perfect to refer to an event that began in the past and before another action or event in the past. The action or event that that happened first is in the past perfect and the one that follows in the past simple.
Examples:
 
I’d read the book before I saw the movie.
 
Donna had just left when you called.
 
Had you ever flown before the trip to France?


2. The past perfect is used for actions or events that happened before a specific time in the past.
Examples:
 
I had already woken up when the alarm clock rang at 7am.
 
He hadn’t been to France before the trip in 2008.


3. As with the present perfect, we also use the past perfect simple for situations that began in the past and continued to a specific point in time in the past, as we cannot use the continuous tenses with certain verbs.
Examples:

She had only owned one car before she bought her new BMW.
 
I’d been depressed for a long time before I changed jobs.
